    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>July 18-20, 2025</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Happy birthday Turtlestitch! Ten years after Andrea Mayr first presented Turtlestitch with a masterclass in Amsterdam, there are many reasons to celebrate. Over the last ten years, Turtlestitch has won the hearts of children, artists and educators around the world. Part of the community has gathered at conferences for Turtlestich's roots, Scratch and Snap! Celebrating a decade of Turtlestitch will give many more people the opportunity to join and share. The venue will be <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/909540/lochal-library-mecanoo-plus-civic-architects-plus-braaksma-and-roos-architectenbureau">LocHal</a>, Tilburg, The Netherlands, an innovative public library, situated next to the well connected Tilburg Centraal station. The former locomotive sheds have been redeveloped into a great cultural hotspot, offering rooms for both talks and workshops. Turtlestitch creates a highly motivational opportunity for learners of all ages to explore computer programming while designing digital embroideries - a great opportunity for local coding clubs to embrace new ways to engage with digital tools that are creative, artistic and educational.</p>

She realized the need for a programming language that was more accessible and understandable for children and collaborated with Seympur Papert and Wally Feurzig to develop the programming language Logo in 1967. An important feature of Logo was the use of 'turtle graphics' - making a robot turtle create drawings through simple movements, and this has informed the way in which Turtlestitch drives the embroidery machine.</p>
