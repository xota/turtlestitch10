    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>July 18-20, 2025</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Happy birthday Turtlestitch! Ten years after Andrea Mayr-Stalder and Michael Aschauer first presented Turtlestitch with a masterclass in Amsterdam, there are many reasons to celebrate. Over the last ten years, Turtlestitch has won the hearts of children, artists and educators around the world. Part of the community has gathered at conferences for Turtlestich's roots, Scratch and Snap! Celebrating a decade of Turtlestitch will give many more people the opportunity to join and share. The venue will be <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/909540/lochal-library-mecanoo-plus-civic-architects-plus-braaksma-and-roos-architectenbureau">LocHal</a>, Tilburg, The Netherlands, an innovative public library, situated next to the well connected Tilburg Centraal station. The former locomotive sheds have been redeveloped into a great cultural hotspot, offering rooms for both talks and workshops. Turtlestitch creates a highly motivational opportunity for learners of all ages to explore computer programming while designing digital embroideries - a great opportunity for local coding clubs to embrace new ways to engage with digital tools that are creative, artistic and educational.</p>

		<p>Introducing StichLAB, an OpenSource DIY Embroidery Maschine featuring TurtleStich</p>
		<hr>
		<p>StitchLAB is a low-cost, open-source embroidery machine created by upgrading old sewing machines with widely available DIY 3D-printer components and software. The modular hardware (3D-printed parts, Raspberry Pi) and software (Klipper) enable new and exciting ways to work with embroidery machines—whether stitching with a game controller or running TurtleStitch directly on the machine. This workshop provides insights into the development process and a hands-on experience with the machine. StitchLAB was developed by Paul-Reza Klein (Studio Praxistest), Walter Lunzer, and Ute Neuber (Department of Textiles) at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.<br>

		<p>Put down your computer, tie up your shoes, and make the world your TurtleStitch stage. All you need is a free running app to start coding with your feet. You can plan out your path or simply see where your feet take you. When you are finished, you’ll have an image of how you moved through space. This will be used to code a satisfying TurtleStitch design. Don’t be surprised to find that you are challenged to walk/run more, making TurtleStitch a part of a creative and healthy lifestyle.<br>

		<p>Snap! has a lot of power user features that are also available in TurtleStitch. But as it is often with these features, they aren't really discoverable if you don't already know that they are there. In this talk, I want to share 10 tips in 10 minutes of things that you might not yet be aware of that help me program in TurtleStitch or write curriculum. Learn how to translate custom blocks or create your own block libraries to share with a class, create script and IDE pictures without backgrounds, create blocks with images in the block titles and many more helpful features.<br>

		<h4>Small is beautiful - focussing on the stitch - Richard Millwood (<a href="https://turtlestitch.org/users/Richard">Richard</a>)</h4>
		<p>TurtleStitch comes with some repeating styles for stitching - can we vary as we sew?</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Great aesthetic value is gained by using a computer to generate interesting graphic forms using TurtleStitch, but usually stitches which are built in to TurtleStitch are used. This talk is to explain how we can use TurtleStitch to vary the stitches themselves, so that they may change their form according to an algorithm, random chance or some linear function of their position in a line of sewing. Such a focus on the micro level is certainly found in hand sewing and may prove a fertile area for artistic and mathematical exploration.<br>

We will learn a little about these materials - their source and sustainability. Each of us can then use these materials to make and take way a personalised LED 'Glowie'.<br/>A table for putting stuff on is the only furniture needed.<br/>Space for standing in a circle.

		<p>Stich your face with a single continuous line!</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Given a picture of your face or any sketch, we can turn it into an embroidery/stitch using just a single continuous line! This project has been inspired by ""Mona Lisa TSP Challenge"" by the University of Waterloo. In the talk, I'm going to cover all the necessary domain knowledge required to theoretically compute it as well as walk you through the entire pipeline of the project to go from the input image to finally exporting the .dst file, which can be imported into your sewing machine to stitch your image.<br>

		<p>How to Make TurtleStitch Projects Instagram Worthy! ... and what does that really mean?</p>
		<hr>
		<p>We can teach computer science through the arts. <br/>We can make the abstract of coding and programming real and touchable with TurtleStitch. <br/>The bigger question that remains, is how do we fill that gap between the point of making a coded TurtleStitch project and the point when a student (or any human) is so excited that they want to Instagram it? And what does that even mean?<br/><br/>When a project becomes personally expressive and satisfying, it is human nature to share it and isn’t that exactly what defines great learning? How do we articulate the pedagogy that creates these magic moments and why is TurtleStich a perfect companion for this mission?<br/><br/>This workshop proposes some concrete steps and projects to use to inspire and bridge that gap.<br>

		<p>In this talk, we explore the story of human creativity, starting with the myth of Arachne. We look at how weaving tools have changed over time, from hand-weaving to the invention of the Jacquard loom. We’ll see how punched cards, used in the loom, helped to inspire the first ideas of modern computing. Even though weaving and programming seem very different, they share surprising connections. By mixing old and new technologies, we show how TurtleStitch Platform supports creative collaboration, using code as a new thread of expression.<br>

		<p>It is a known problem that people are diverse in the way they read out loud a computer program, and that this may indicate a problem regarding their understanding the program. This workshop will demonstrate an early prototype of a Snap! microworld with limited commands and using turtle graphics to help the development of a 'speaking' literacy with regard to Snap! programs.

        <p class="w3-justify">The Beauty and Joy of Stitching TurtleStitch brings together the tactile world of textiles with the logical beauty of code, opening up endless possibilities for creative expression. Stitching becomes a way to think—with points becoming lines, patterns emerging through randomness or data, and designs evolving from algorithms, images, or even sensor input. This hybrid practice invites us to explore how material, technology, and ideas intersect—whether through artistic exploration or computational thinking. At the TurtleStitch 10 gathering in Tilburg, we celebrate this richness: from playful experimentation to deep discussions about AI-supported design, data architectures, and the educational potential of stitching as a meaningful and joyful practice.</p>
