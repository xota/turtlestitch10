Titel-EN:	StichLAB meets TurtleStitch
Teaser-EN:	Introducing StichLAB, an OpenSource DIY Embroidery Maschine featuring  TurtleStich
Omschrijving-EN:	StitchLAB is a low-cost, open-source embroidery machine created by upgrading old sewing machines with widely available DIY 3D-printer components and software. The modular hardware (3D-printed parts, Raspberry Pi) and software (Klipper) enable new and exciting ways to work with embroidery machines—whether stitching with a game controller or running TurtleStitch directly on the machine. This workshop provides insights into the development process and a hands-on experience with the machine. StitchLAB was developed by Paul-Reza Klein (Studio Praxistest), Walter Lunzer, and Ute Neuber (Department of Textiles) at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.

But as it is often with these features, they aren't really discoverable if you don't already know that they are there. In this talk, I want to share 10 tips in 10 minutes of things that you might not yet be aware of that help me program in TurtleStitch or write curriculum. Learn how to translate custom blocks or create your own block libraries to share with a class, create script and IDE pictures without backgrounds, create blocks with images in the block titles and many more helpful features.

Teaser-EN:	TurtleStitch comes with some repeating styles for stitching - can we vary as we sew?
Omschrijving-EN:	Great aesthetic value is gained by using a computer to generate interesting graphic forms using TurtleStitch, but usually stitches which are built in to TurtleStitch are used. This talk is to explain how we can use TurtleStitch to vary the stitches themselves, so that they may change their form according to an algorithm, random chance or some linear function of their position in a line of sewing. Such a focus on the micro level is certainly found in hand sewing and may prove a fertile area for artistic and mathematical exploration.

Omschrijving-EN:	In this workshop, participants will learn how to design embroidered patterns in TurtleStitch and integrate simple electronic components (like LEDs, touch sensors, or motion sensors) into their fabric projects using conductive thread and microcontrollers. The session will introduce basic concepts of e-textiles, show real-world applications, and guide participants through a hands-on project to build a small interactive embroidery prototype. This workshop is ideal for educators, makers, and designers looking to merge art, technology, and storytelling through fabric-based computing.

RETURNThe bigger question that remains, is how do we fill that gap between the point of making a coded TurtleStitch project and the point when a student (or any human) is so excited that they want to Instagram it? And what does that even mean?RETURNRETURNWhen a project becomes personally expressive and satisfying, it is human nature to share it and isn’t that exactly what defines great learning? How do we articulate the pedagogy that creates these magic moments and why is TurtleStich a perfect companion for this mission?RETURNRETURNThis workshop proposes some concrete steps and projects to use to inspire and bridge that gap.

We look at how weaving tools have changed over time, from hand-weaving to the invention of the Jacquard loom. We’ll see how punched cards, used in the loom, helped to inspire the first ideas of modern computing. Even though weaving and programming seem very different, they share surprising connections. By mixing old and new technologies, we show how TurtleStitch Platform supports creative collaboration, using code as a new thread of expression.

This workshop will demonstrate an early prototype of a Snap! microworld with limited commands and using turtle graphics to help the development of a 'speaking' literacy with regard to Snap! programs. Participants who enjoy designing or are interested in pedagogy for early programmers will practically take the prototype further in small groups or as individuals to explore the ideas and improve the practice.

Teaser-EN:	Unleash your creativity without limits—TurtleStitch turns code into embroidery art faster than a pen!
Omschrijving-EN:	To celebrate TurtleStitch’s 10th anniversary, this workshop introduces a major upgrade to two block libraries, enhancing both creative freedom and precision in machine embroidery. The new features include: (1) Natural Curve Drawing, enabling mouse-followed sketching that converts freehand gestures into smooth stitch-ready paths; (2) Smart Area Filling, allowing parametric control over angle, density, and custom stitch patterns; and (3) Custom Stitch & Fill Methods, supporting user-defined stitch styles (e.g., square, diamond) for reuse.RETURNRETURNParticipants will engage in a hands-on demo project, designing an embroidery pattern as intuitively as drawing on paper using keyboard and mouse input. By the end, attendees will master the new blocks for organic design and structured filling, create a personalized embroidery file for physical stitching, and gain inspiration for merging analog artistry with digital precision.RETURNRETURNThis workshop is ideal for coders, artists, and educators seeking to explore expressive and repeatable textile art. Join us in celebrating a decade of TurtleStitch by pushing its creative boundaries together.

Teaser-EN:	How well can you code with your feet?
Omschrijving-EN:	Put down your computer, tie up your shoes, and make the world your TurtleStitch stage. All you need is a free running app to start coding with your feet. You can plan out your path or simply see where your feet take you. When you are finished, you’ll have an image of how you moved through space. This will be used to code a satisfying TurtleStitch design.  Don’t be surprised to find that you are challenged to walk/run more, making TurtleStitch a part of a creative and healthy lifestyle.

Titel-EN:	Self organised support by TurtleStitch community
Teaser-EN:	Setting up support is work. Inspired by efforts of our family (Scratch, Snap!, Microblocks) this workshop will build a similar system for the TurtleStitch community.
Omschrijving-EN:	We want to group the questions and ideas of the community in a organised,  open and inviting place. Too much solutions live in inboxes a small group of people. Where they are forgotten, never updated. We realise this is the start of continuous work, so extra attention should be paid on how to manage this over months and years.
