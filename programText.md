###StichLAB meets Turtlestitch
Introducing StichLAB, an OpenSource DIY Embroidery Maschine featuring  TurtleStich **Paul-Reza Klein, Walter Lunzer ** (prntr)
Saturday	9:30-10:30	Large auditorium
medium (max 60)
StitchLAB is a low-cost, open-source embroidery machine created by upgrading old sewing machines with widely available DIY 3D-printer components and software. The modular hardware (3D-printed parts, Raspberry Pi) and software (Klipper) enable new and exciting ways to work with embroidery machines—whether stitching with a game controller or running TurtleStitch directly on the machine. This workshop provides insights into the development process and a hands-on experience with the machine. StitchLAB was developed by Paul-Reza Klein (Studio Praxistest), Walter Lunzer, and Ute Neuber (Department of Textiles) at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.
 (The Workshop will  have Hands On aspects but, due to the stage of development and only one of the Machines on site, it will be more of a mixture of Talk and Workshop.   )


###From Seashore to TurtleStitch
How seaweed made me a better coder. **Beth Lloyd** (lloydcrew)
Saturday	9:30-10:30	Large auditorium
long (max 60)
Living on the Atlantic coast in Newport, Rhode Island, I found myself getting curious about seaweed. I kept thinking, ""I should be able to embroider these beautiful specimens."" After two years, I finally figured out how to code them in TurtleStitch. Join me on this journey of discovery without even getting your feet wet!
 (Just a projector to show slides.)

###Get Up and Running with TurtleStitch
How well can you code with your feet? **Beth Lloyd** (lloydcrew)
Saturday	10:30-11:30	Small auditorium
short (max 30)
Put down your computer, tie up your shoes, and make the world your TurtleStitch stage. All you need is a free running app to start coding with your feet. You can plan out your path or simply see where your feet take you. When you are finished, you’ll have an image of how you moved through space. This will be used to code a satisfying TurtleStitch design.  Don’t be surprised to find that you are challenged to walk/run more, making TurtleStitch a part of a creative and healthy lifestyle.
 (I believe Cynthia will be my assistant!)

###10 things you might not have known about Turtlestitch
Learn a couple of tricks in the TurtleStitch IDE that you might not yet be aware of :) **Jadga Hügle** (jadga)
Saturday	10:30-11:30	Small auditorium
short (max 30)
Snap! has a lot of power user features that are also available in TurtleStitch. But as it is often with these features, they aren't really discoverable  if you don't already know that they're there. In this talk, I want to share 10 tips in 10 minutes of things that you might not yet be aware of that help me program in TurtleStitch or write curriculum. Learn how to translate custom blocks or create your own block libraries to share with a class, create script and IDE pictures without backgrounds, create blocks with images in the block titles and many more helpful features.
 

###Small is beautiful - focussing on the stitch
TurtleStitch comes with some repeating styles for stitching - can we vary as we sew? **Richard Millwood** (Richard)
Saturday	10:30-11:30	Small auditorium
short (max 30)
Great aesthetic value is gained by using a computer to generate interesting graphic forms using Turtlestitch, but usually stitches which are built in to Turtlestitch are used. This talk is to explain how we can use Turtlestitch to vary the stitches themselves, so that they may change their form according to an algorithm, random chance or some linear function of their position in a line of sewing. Such a focus on the micro level is certainly found in hand sewing and may prove a fertile area for artistic and mathematical exploration.

###Blending Code and Craft: Interactive Embroidery with Sensors and TurtleStitch
Explore how TurtleStitch and basic electronics can be combined to create dynamic, interactive embroidery pieces that respond to touch, motion, or sound. **Matthew koomson** Saturday	12:00-13:00	Futurelab
workshop (max )
In this workshop, participants will learn how to design embroidered patterns in TurtleStitch and integrate simple electronic components (like LEDs, touch sensors, or motion sensors) into their fabric projects using conductive thread and microcontrollers. The session will introduce basic concepts of e-textiles, show real-world applications, and guide participants through a hands-on project to build a small interactive embroidery prototype. This workshop is ideal for educators, makers, and designers looking to merge art, technology, and storytelling through fabric-based computing.
 (* Projector and screen for demo
* Tables for hands-on activities
* Power outlets for laptops and microcontrollers
* Basic kits with conductive thread, fabric swatches, LEDs, small microcontrollers (e.g., Micro:bit or Arduino), and batteries
* Participants should bring a laptop

###Chicken & Chips
a hands-on sensemaking excercise to introduce ourselves to the role semi-conductors in electronic circuits **Mags Amond** (magsamond)
Saturday	12:00-13:00	Large auditorium
medium (max 60)
All computers depend on semi-conducting materials - this brief excercise might help us to understand and appreciate them.
We will form a human circuit incorporating a small chirpy chicken toy called Pieu Pieu, who will act as both input (battery) and output (chirper) in our circuit.
We will do a group investigation into conducting and non-conducting materials in simple circuits.
We will introduce ouselves to semi-conducting materials using a diode which is central to all electronic circuits. We will learn a little about these materials - their source and sustainability.
Each of us can then use these materials to make and take way a personalised LED 'Glowie'. 
(This is best for small groups, but can be done over and over - in one hour, three groups in a row is good.
A table for putting stuff on is the only furniture needed.
Space for standing in a circle.
A supply of 3v lithium 'coin' batteries (cheapest from IKEA or some such discount store).
LEDS.
Sticky tape.
Will people have name badges or some such - they can stick their 'glowies' on the badges.)


###Starting TurtleStitch
Cynthia and Beth will get you started **Cynthia Solomon** (cynthiasolomon)

###Face Stitching
Stich your face with a single continuous line! **Bhavik Dodda** (Bhavik_Dodda)
Saturday	14:00-15:00	Futurelab
medium (max 30)
Given a picture of your face or any sketch, we can turn it into an embroidery/stitch using just a single continuous line! This project has been inspired by ""Mona Lisa TSP Challenge"" by the University of Waterloo. In the talk, I'm going to cover all the necessary domain knowledge required to theoretically compute it as well as walk you through the entire pipeline of the project to go from the input image to finally exporting the .dst file, which can be imported into your sewing machine to stitch your image.
 (Intended audience: Math/Art Enthusiasts.
Would need to share my screen and demonstrate.
Bonus: It would be great if I could generate a .dst file during the demonstration for any of your images, send it to one of your volunteers and stitch it over there for the live demo!)


###The Beauty of Coding:  Koch Snowflake
This TurtleStitch program is a recursive program **Elaine Wolfe** (Elaine)
Saturday	14:00-15:00	Futurelab
short (max 30)
A link to the slides, https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IBXjHPVGl6vBtBFvvbJIAZbq6kvitxws86n_5CLEObs/edit?usp=sharing
 (I will not be attending the workshop. I could present  this talk via Zoom.  Where should I send the 25 Koch Snowflakes that I have embroidered? Included with the embroidery is a little booklet explaining how the Koch snowflake was coded.  I have also embroidered a tote bag that I have made for the conference exemplifying what can be done with TurtleStitch.  The tote bag pattern was coded in TurtleStitch in addition to the design on the tote bag. (The tote bag can either be given to Andrea or as a  token of appreciation or as a giveaway.))


###Bodies as Data: From Pose Detection to Stitched Patterns
Create stitched patterns using your body as the creative input, no keyboard or mouse needed! **Stephen Howell** Saturday	14:00-15:30	Small auditorium
extended (max 30)
Participants will explore how machine learning pose detection can transform physical movement into creative data streams. Using familiar Scratch blocks, we'll build projects that capture body positions and gestures, then investigate how this embodied data might translate into stitchable patterns and designs.
 (Audience: children to adults. Some space / ability to cordon off small area needed for cameras. Electricity sockets x 2. Small table and chair for presenter (if low table, no chair needed if podium style). Projector / large TV for audience. Happy to run as 90 minute workshop or 180 minutes as timetable requires. )


###Lets grow trees
 getting started with recursion **TBA** (megjlow)
Saturday	14:00-15:00	Workshops 1-3
workshop (max 20)
Recursion is a powerful programming technique that allows complex structures to emerge from simple rules—and trees are the perfect example! Each branch divides into smaller branches, creating intricate patterns that resemble nature itself.
In this hands on workshop, you'll discover how recursion works and use it to generate tree-like patterns with TurtleStitch. We'll start by developing a simple recursive tree, breaking down its structure step by step. Then, we'll explore how to introduce variations, randomness, and creative elements to generate unique tree designs.
###Create a Critter
Design Your Own Finger Puppet or Mini Buddy with TurtleStitch **TBA** (megjlow)
Saturday	14:00-15:00	Workshops 1-3
workshop (max 20)
Participants of all ages are invited to design and make their very critter using TurtleStitch, a visual programming platform that turns code into embroidery. You can choose to create a finger puppet, or a pocket sized toy or mini-buddy.
TurtleStitch is used to create the outline of your puppet. Once your design is ready, it will be created using a digital embroidery machine, which will stitch your creation onto two layers of colourful fabric.
From there, you’ll cut out your creation and bring it to life! Whether you want to make a finger puppet, a small toy, or a cuddly pocket-sized companion, you can decorate your critter with eyes, hair, accessories, and more to give it a unique personality.
This workshop is useful for STEM classrooms seeking to mix maths, coding and creativity, or for drop in sessions at libraries, museums or community centres. 
###Instagrammable
How to Make Turtlestitch Projects Instagram Worthy! ... and what does that really mean? **Susan Ettenheim** (susanettenheim)
Saturday	15:00-16:00	Futurelab
workshop (max 30)
We can teach computer science through the arts. 
We can make the abstract of coding and programming real and touchable with Turtlestitch. 
The bigger question that remains, is how do we fill that gap between the point of making a coded Turtlestitch project and the point when a student (or any human) is so excited that they want to Instagram it? And what does that even mean?

When a project becomes personally expressive and satisfying, it is human nature to share it and isn’t that exactly what defines great learning? How do we articulate the pedagogy that creates these magic moments and why is TurtleStich a perfect companion for this mission?

This workshop proposes some concrete steps and projects to use to inspire and bridge that gap.

###Arachne and Téchne: the story of a turtle who wanted to become a spider
 From weaving a spider web to coding a TurtleStitch project **Maria Beatrice Rapaccini** (brapacc)
Saturday	15:30-16:30	Large auditorium
short (max 60)
In this talk, we explore the story of human creativity, starting with the myth of Arachne. We look at how weaving tools have changed over time , from hand-weaving to the invention of the Jacquard loom. We’ll see how punched cards, used in the loom, helped inspire the first ideas of modern computing. Even though weaving and programming seem very different, they share surprising connections. By mixing old and new technologies, we show how Turtlestitch Platform supports creative collaboration, using code new thread of expression
(This the slides I presented at MakerFaire in Orebro, Sweden. 
in this vodeo we have the Italian translation for a introductory course I had on Turtlestitch. I have to modify a ltittle  the talk to the Turtlestich audience within next meeting (june)

###Finding Patterns in Your Environment
Geometry is everywhere around us - let's use it to create local, custom merchandise **Jadga Hügle** (jadga)
Saturday	15:30-16:30	Large auditorium
medium (max 60)
For quite a while I've noticed that geometric patterns are all around us. And if you've seen them once, you can't unsee them. 
In this talk, I want to share a couple of ideas from different cities and cultural backgrounds on how to use these unique geometries for generative art in Turtlestitch. How to identify patterns, recode and remix them and make custom merchandise for your city, region, school,...
 (no, thanks. my co-presenter would potentially be Sinobia Kenny (if she's coming, I'd love to give her a little more time), if she's not coming, I can totally do with a 10-15 minutes short talk :) )

The TeachMeet is an Open Space at which all are welcome. 
Attendees are invited to put their name down to do share a short presentation (between 2 and 7 minutes approx.) in a relaxed atmosphere. There is no strict agenda. The order will be randomly chosen on the night. It is a social ocassion, at which we can learn from each other as well as relax together. Timekeeping will be strict but fun! 
 (We need to let people know about it in advance and tell them how to sign up to present -  that might be best done in person during Friday evening and Saturday. 
Equipment is usually a good projection set up, some people may need sound.
Either a circle of chairs, or a selection of tables and chairs.
If possible some simple treats and beverage.

###How do we say our code out loud?
Jigsaw programming is very visual but this doesn't help us to say it out loud - how should we? **Richard Millwood** (Richard)
Sunday	12:00-12:30	Small auditorium
workshop (max 30)
It is a known problem that people are diverse in the way they read out loud a computer program, and that this may indicate a problem regarding their understanding the program. This workshop will demonstrate an early prototype of a Snap! microworld with limited commands and using turtle graphics to help the development of a 'speaking' literacy with regard to Snap! programs. Participants who enjoy designing or are interested in pedagogy for early programmers will practically take the prototype further in small groups or as individuals to explore the ideas and improve the practice.
 (None. Particpants should bring laptops.)


###Blockly Games - learn to think like a turtle
Navigate the maze, make movies with maths, make music and more **Mags Amond** (magsamond)
Sunday	12:30-13:30	Futurelab
long (max 30)
In this self-paced workshop, we will work with a partner through the Blockly levels ....
> navigate the maze with Google MapMan, solve level 10 and claim a prize!
> use conditionals in control-flow to fly the Bird past the snakes back to her next
> use loops and nested loops to take the Turtle on a trip
> use maths equations to make a mini animated Movie
> use functions to compose music for your own mini-orchestra
> switch between block based and text based commands in the battle Pond

Neil Frazer's Blockly Games are designed as an introduction, a precursor to text-based programming. There are built-in exit strategies in the design - text on blocks is in lower case, java script displayed after each block based success, the final game is built within a text editor.  Contextually aware popups appear and disappear to help with flow.
 (> Blockly games can run on laptop, tablet, mobile, both online and offline - it could be downloaded in English and Dutch (and many other languages)
> Best run as a short workshop, 45 minutes; maybe twice in the 90 minutes
> ideal as a parent & child paired activity, where both. are relative beginners)


###Beyond the Mouse & Keyboard: The Joy of Body-Responsive Coding
From clicks to kicks: how embodied interaction transforms the joy of learning to code **Stephen Howell** Sunday	12:30-13:30	Large auditorium
long (max 60)
What shifts when students can control their Scratch projects by jumping, dancing, or striking poses instead of clicking keys or moving the mouse?

###TurtleStitch: Where Code Beats Pen!
Unleash your creativity without limits—TurtleStitch turns code into embroidery art faster than a pen! **Simon Mong** (SimonMong)
Sunday	13:30-14:30	Futurelab
workshop (max 30)
To celebrate TurtleStitch’s 10th anniversary, I’m excited to host a hands-on workshop showcasing a major upgrade to two block libraries, designed to bridge the gap between creative freedom and precision in machine embroidery.
Key Features:
Natural Curve Drawing: New blocks enable mouse-followed natural sketching, turning freehand gestures into smooth stitch-ready paths.
Smart Area Filling: Fill bounded regions with parametric control over angle, density, and even user-defined stitch patterns.
Custom Stitch & Fill Methods: Users can now define and reuse their own stitch styles (e.g., square, diamond) and fill methods.

Workshop Flow:
Participants will learn these blocks through a fun demo project—designing an embroidery pattern as intuitively as drawing on paper, using keyboard and mouse. By the end, attendees will:

Master the new blocks for organic design and structured filling.
Create a personalized embroidery file to stitch physically.
Leave inspired to merge analog artistry with digital precision.

Why Attend?
Whether you’re a coder, artist, or educator, this upgrade empowers expressive and repeatable textile art. Let’s celebrate a decade of TurtleStitch by pushing its creative limits together!
 

###Get Up and Running with TurtleStitch
How well can you code with your feet? **Beth Lloyd** (lloydcrew)
Sunday	15:00-16:00	Futurelab
workshop (max 30)
Put down your computer, tie up your shoes, and make the world your TurtleStitch stage. All you need is a free running app to start coding with your feet. You can plan out your path or simply see where your feet take you. When you are finished, you’ll have an image of how you moved through space. This will be used to code a satisfying TurtleStitch design.  Don’t be surprised to find that you are challenged to walk/run more, making TurtleStitch a part of a creative and healthy lifestyle.
 (I believe Cynthia will be my assistant!)


###Self organised support by TurtleStitch community
Setting up support is work. Inspired by efforts of our family (Scratch, Snap!, Microblocks) this workshop will build a similar system for the TurtleStitch community. **Joek van Montfort** (xota)
Sunday	15:00-16:00	Small auditorium
bof (max 30)
We want to group the questions and ideas of the community in a organised,  open and inviting place. Too much solutions live in inboxes a small group of people. Where they are forgotten, never updated. We realise this is the start of continuous work, so extra attention should be paid on how to manage this over months and years.
 

###Loops, Twirls & Swirls
Creative and playful patterns exploring the built in embroidery commands.  **Margaret Low** (megjlow)
Sunday	15:00-16:30	Workshops 1-3
workshop (max 40)
This hands-on workshop explores the creative potential of TurtleStitch’s built-in embroidery commands (the dark green section). Whether you’re new to TurtleStitch or looking expand your knowledge of TurtleStitch, this session will guide you through a variety of techniques to generate stunning geometric patterns using a range of built in embroidery commands. 

From precise lines and structured squares to the elegance of bows and intricate rectangles, we'll show how simple commands can produce complex and visually striking designs. Through interactive activities, you will experiment with key embroidery functions, understanding how adjustments in placement, repetition, and orientation can transform basic shapes into dynamic compositions.

By the end of the session, you will have gained confidence in using the full range of embroidery commands, equipping you with the skills to design your own unique designs. 
 (The plan is to run the workshop as a 'follow me' style to explore the built in embroidery commands, then participants can create their own patterns. It would be useful to have some additional tutorial assistance to help anyone new to TurtleStitch to keep up.  AV: useful to have a screen at the front of the room, so people can see and follow what I'm doing in TurtleStitch. )
